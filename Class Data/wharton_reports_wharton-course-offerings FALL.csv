This is an intermediate level course on financial reporting which covers more complicated transactions than those found in ACCT 1010. We will cover major valuation and financial reporting topics on all three major sections of the balance sheet-assets, liabilities, and equity-along with their consequences for net income and cash flows. Case studies and illustrative examples from the financial press will be used to increase your familiarity with actual firms' financial statements and to emphasize the effect of financial accounting rules on the information presented in financial statements. After completing this course, you will have obtained many of the tools necessary to both prepare and analyze financial statements and accounting information provided by firms. You will acquire an understanding of both the ""how"" of accounting procedures and the underlying reasons ""why"" these practices are adopted. These skills are essential for pursuing a broad range of professions in accounting and finance.","P","ACCT2120001","ACCT 1010","","WH","ACCT","Penn In Touch","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1863940","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=ACCT2120","2.940000"

The course is especially useful for anyone interested in working on the buy or sell side. The course provides both a framework for and the tools necessary to analyze financial statements. At the conceptual level, it emphasizes that preparers and users of financial statements have different objectives and incentives. At the same time, the course is applied and stresses the use of actual financial statements. For example, students learn how to detect when firms are managing earnings and/or balance sheets. It draws heavily on real business problems and uses cases to illustrate the application of the techniques and tools.

The key themes of the framework - all parties, all taxes and all costs - are applied to decision contexts such as investments, compensation, organizational form, regulated industries, financial instruments, tax-sheltered investments, mergers and acquisitions, multinational, and multistate.

Moreover, consumer finance comprises an enormous sector of the economy, including products like credit cards, student loans, mortgages, retail banking, insurance, and a wide variety of retirement savings vehicles and investment alternatives. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in the FinTech arena are integrating innovative approaches to help consumers. Though virtually all people use these products, many find financial decisions to be confusing and complex, rendering them susceptible to fraud and deception. As a result, government regulation plays a major role in these markets. This course intended for Penn undergraduates considers economic models of household decisions and examines evidence on how consumers are managing (and mismanaging) their finances.

Moreover, consumer finance comprises an enormous sector of the economy, including products like credit cards, student loans, mortgages, retail banking, insurance, and a wide variety of retirement savings vehicles and investment alternatives. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in the FinTech arena are integrating innovative approaches to help consumers. Though virtually all people use these products, many find financial decisions to be confusing and complex, rendering them susceptible to fraud and deception. As a result, government regulation plays a major role in these markets. This course intended for Penn undergraduates considers economic models of household decisions and examines evidence on how consumers are managing (and mismanaging) their finances.

We will emphasize (a) the critical role of an underlying economic theory of behavior in interpreting data and guiding analysis, as well as (b) a range of advanced techniques for inferring causality from data, such as randomized controlled trials, regression discontinuity, difference-in-difference, audit study (mystery shopping) approaches and stock-market event studies. The issue of causality, and the relevance of thinking about models and methods for inferring causality, is just as central and important for ""Big Data"" as it is when working with traditional data sets in business and public policy. The emphasis will not be on proofs and derivations but rather on understanding the underlying concepts, the practical use, implications and limitations of techniques. Students will work intensively with data, drawing from examples in business and public policy, to develop the skills to use data analysis to make better decisions. All analysis will be conducted using R. The goals of the course are for students to become expert consumers able to interpret and evaluate empirical studies as well as expert producers of convincing empirical analysis themselves.","P","BEPP2800001","STAT 1020 OR STAT 1120 OR STAT 4310 OR ECON 2310 OR PSCI 1801 OR SOCI 2010","","WH","BEPP","Penn In Touch","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1878137","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=BEPP2800","2.810000"

Development of the tools of game theory and the application of those tools is emphasized. Game theory has become an important tool for managers and consultants in analyzing and implementing tactical as well as strategic actions. This course will primarily focus on examples useful for developing competitive strategy in the private sector (pricing and product strategy, capacity choices, contracting and negotiating, signaling and bluffing, takeover strategy, etc.). Game theory can also be used to address problems relevant to a firm's organizational strategy (e.g., internal incentives and information flow within a firm) and to a firm's non-market environment (e.g., strategic trade policies, litigation and regulation strategy). Recommended background in intermediate microeconomics or equivalent. It is expected that the student has been introduced to some basic game theory. There will be a quick review of the basics and some recommended supplemental readings for those who have little or no background in game theory.","S","MGMT7840401","","","WM","BEPP","Course Match","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1879419","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=BEPP7840",""

Presentations both of papers assigned for other classes and of research leading toward a dissertation are appropriate in BEPP 9000.

It will have a primarily U.S.-centric view that is largely applicable to other markets. Venture capital is not explicitly addressed in this course. Course topics will address the entirety of the deal process and value creation in the post-acquisition period, and will include the following: - LBO modeling - Commercial due diligence (principles and execution) - Debt financing - Sale & purchase agreements (SPA) - Accounting diligence - Deal structuring - Operations & Value creation Throughout the course, students will learn about each element of the deal process through in-class lectures, while concurrently applying those learnings to former transactions (these must be old enough that sharing material is no longer sensitive). The in-class lectures will cover conceptual frameworks, practical considerations and real-world case studies and examples. There will be four assignments in this course. The first three assignments will apply these learnings to the art of the deal through a real world lens. In the last assignment, students will develop a value creation plan for designated public companies ""TargetCo1"" and ""TargetCo2"". Students are expected to actively engage in classroom discussions, challenging one another and the instructors about how to think through these issues in an ever-evolving investment world. In addition, throughout the course, students are expected to work as a team on the assignments.","P","FNCE4010001","(FNCE 1000 OR FNCE 1008) AND (FNCE 1010 OR FNCE 1018) AND WH 1010 AND WH 2010 AND MGMT 3010","","WH","FNCE","Penn In Touch","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1869361","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=FNCE4010","3.213333"

Special attention will be paid to nursing homes and senior housing options and their past, present and future role within the overall health care system in the United States. The course will start with an overview of the senior population with special attention to their health and social needs. Several classes will be held off campus at selected nursing facilities and senior housing complexes. In addition, a broad range of special programs and services will be reviewed such as sub-acute care, long term care insurance, Medicare Risk Programs, elderly housing, adult day care, managed care, Medicare Part D, case management, hospice and other recent developments. Throughout the course, emphasis will be placed on entrepreneurial opportunities to serve the senior market at all levels. Students are required to produce a paper for this course that focuses on a specific area impacting the senior market. This is a wonderful opportunity for students to select an area of personal interest and conduct an in depth review of that area including making direct contact with national experts within the topic selected. All student topics must be approved during the first two weeks of class and the depth of research required agreed upon by the by the student and the instructor. Interested students not in the HCMG major are urged to speak to the instructor before enrolling in the course.","P","HCMG8550002","","","WM","HCMG","Course Match","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1880709","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=HCMG8550","3.100000"

However, successfully applying AI in the complex healthcare ecosystem requires not only technical expertise but also a clear understanding of clinical, operational, and strategic context. Healthcare leaders must grasp not only the potential of AI but also its limitations, ethical implications, and operational challenges. This course invites students to explore these issues, equipping them with the tools to think strategically and methodically about the role of AI in the healthcare. This is a practical course that emphasizes what can be achieved today and how to navigate real-world implementation challenges. By focusing on the realities of applying AI on the ground—technical hurdles, clinician collaboration, and organizational readiness—students will develop a nuanced and pragmatic understanding of how to leverage AI to drive concrete impact in healthcare organizations. Through a combination of lectures, case studies, and guest speakers, students will explore the full lifecycle of healthcare AI projects. Topics include evaluating AI use cases, navigating technical and clinical implementation challenges, and designing a roadmap for scaling AI within an organization. The course also addresses broader considerations such as bias and equity, intellectual property, and regulation in healthcare AI. Students will gain practical, hands-on experience by analyzing real-world case studies and engaging in discussions with leaders in healthcare and AI. By the end of the course, participants will be prepared to (1) critically assess AI opportunities, (2) collaborate effectively with technical and clinical teams, and (3) develop strategies for implementing AI solutions that create measurable value in healthcare.","P","HCMG8580001","","","WM","HCMG","Course Match","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1867766","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=HCMG8580",""

Other issues are positive: How do these different systems deal with the tough choices, such as decisions about new technologies? Our focus first on the systems in four large, prototypical OECD countries- Germany, Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom -and then look at other developed and emerging countries with interesting systems - including Italy, Chile, Singapore, Brazil, China and India.

The actual cost to bring a drug from the research labs to patients is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and yet only 10% of all drugs that enter human testing are ever approved, often failing due safety issues or lackluster efficacy.  Therefore, when you factor in the cost of these drug failures, the cost to get a drug approved can reach into the billions.  And that’s not even considering the cost to market the drug once approved.  Despite these inherent clinical and commercial risks coupled with the high costs of developing and marketing a drug, there was over $500 billion of equity capital invested into biotech companies over the past 10 years signaling a robust market where returns are disproportionate to risk. This course will explore funding these risky biotech ventures from two perspectives: the biotech CEO (primary focus of the course) and the biotech investor (secondary focus of the course).  Students will learn about the various ways biotech companies are capitalized (e.g., equity, convertible/structured debt, licensing partnerships, clinical trial financing, royalty monetization, etc.) and the tradeoffs a biotech CEO considers when deciding which options to pursue at various stages of the company’s evolution.  We will also explore first-hand how the biotech investor thinks about the firm’s capital structure when deciding to make an equity investment as well as understand the quantitative (e.g., market & competitive assessments, total financing needs of the firm, NPV) and qualitative (e.g., physician’s proclivity to prescribe, strength of management, etc.) diligence the biotech investor performs prior to making an investment.  For the final project, students will analyze the capital requirements for a biotech company and make recommendations based on the financing options available to the firm. Through readings, lectures, case studies, guest speakers, and a final project, students will learn concepts and analytical frameworks and acquire the tools and skills necessary to make important financing decisions as a biotech CEO.","P","HCMG8770001","FNCE 6110","","WM","HCMG","Course Match","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1862722","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=HCMG8770",""

The course by the Legal Studies and Business Ethics Department is jointly sponsored by the World Bank and Wharton's Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research. The aim of the course is to integrate and strengthen students' academic skills by applying them in cross-functional ways to the production of real-world consulting reports for project founders. The course will also require students to grapple with current ethical and legal challenges that business organizations face, such as defining the purpose of a business, determining how to incorporate global standards like the Sustainable Development Goals or other Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards into a business plan, and designing mechanisms to promote ethical behavior and combat such systemic challenges as corruption.","P","LGST4010001","(LGST 1000 OR LGST 1008 OR LGST 1010 OR LGST 1018) AND WH 1010 AND WH 2010 AND MGMT 3010","","WH","LGST","Penn In Touch","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1879432","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=LGST4010","1.873333"

Criminals attempt to use money from illegal activities in ways that are otherwise legal; governments go to great lengths to forbid it. The result is that everyone – banks and businesses, consumers and entrepreneurs, politicians and citizens, immigrants and tourists, official institutions and a local food truck – is caught in a complex web of legal, historical, financial, and political factors that defines our modern financial system. This course will equip students with an understanding of how and what money laundering is, what to expect as a business executive or entrepreneur in a world where money laundering and its prevention will motivate so many seemingly unrelated opportunities, and provide a broader context for understanding the modern global financial system.","P","LGST7500001","","","WM","LGST","Course Match","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1879028","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=LGST7500",""

It also provides participants an opportunity to investigate an ethical issue of their choosing in some depth, using their field of specialty as context. The seminar assumes no previous exposure to business ethics. Different business ethics theories and frameworks for investigating issues will be discussed, including corporate social responsibility, corporate moral agency, theories of values, and corporate governance. In turn, these theories will be applied to a range of issues, both domestic and international. Such issues include: corruption in host countries, the management of values in modern corporations, the ethical status of the corporation, ethics in sophisticated financial transactions (such as leveraged derivative transactions), and gender discrimination in the context of cultural differences. Literature not only from business ethics, but from professional and applied ethics, law, and organizational behavior will be discussed. Often, guest speakers will address the seminar. At the discretion of the class, special topics of interest to the class will be examined. Students will be expected to write and present a major paper dealing with a current issue within their major field.

More formally, managers formulate strategies and implement those strategies. This course provides a framework for understanding the opportunities and challenges involved in formulating and implementing strategies by taking a ""system"" view of organizations,which means that we examine multiple aspects of how managers address their environments, strategy, structure, culture, tasks, people, and outputs, and how managerial decisions made in these various domains interrelate. The course will help you to understand and analyze how managers can formulate and implement strategies effectively. It will be particularly valuable if you are interested in management consulting, investment analysis, or entrepreneurship - but it will help you to better understand and be a more effective contributor to any organizations you join, whether they are large, established firms or startups.

Nevertheless, the treatment is sufficiently distinctive to make it complementary to those other treatments for a student who is particularly interested in economic change, or is otherwise interested in acquiring a broader view of economics.","P","MGMT2140001","","","WH","MGMT","Penn In Touch","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1876269","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=MGMT2140","3.290000"

The focus is on the competitive strategy of the firm, examining issues central to its long- and short-term competitive position. Students act in the roles of key decision-makers or their advisors and solve problems related to the development or maintenance of the competitive advantage of the firm in a given market. The first module of the course develops an understanding of key strategic frameworks using theoretical readings and case-based discussions. Students will learn concepts and tools for analyzing the competitive environment, strategic position and firm-specific capabilities in order to understand the sources of a firm's competitive advantage. In addition, students will address corporate strategy issues such as the economic logic and administrative challenges associated with diversification choices about horizontal and vertical integration. The second module will be conducted as a multi-session, computer-based simulation in which students will have the opportunity to apply the concepts and tools from module 1 to make strategic decisions. The goal of the course is for students to develop an analytical tool kit for understanding strategic issues and to enrich their appreciation for the thought processes essential to incisive strategic analysis. This course offers students the opportunity to develop a general management perspective by combining their knowledge of specific functional areas with an appreciation for the requirements posed by the need to integrate all functions into a coherent whole. Students will develop skills in structuring and solving complex business problems. In addition to prerequisites, enrollment is limited to seniors and juniors that have completed introductory courses in finance, marketing, and accounting.","P","MGMT2230001","WH 1010 AND MGMT 1010","","WH","MGMT","Penn In Touch","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1880718","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=MGMT2230","2.698000"

This 0.5 CU course challenges the mindset of technological determinism and explores what choice points are available to managers implementing new technologies as well as the engineers who design them. •	Module 1: “Technology and Its Impact on Jobs and Skills” considers which technologies deserve the characterization of “revolutionary” due to their capacity to change entire organizations – and even societies — vs. those that only substitute narrowly for past technologies.   We’ll examine past anxieties related to automation and evaluate the extent to which the “worst-case” scenarios about employment loss have or have not come to pass – and evaluate claims of “this time it’s different”. •	Module 2: “Intelligent Technologies: How Will They Affect Work and Organizations?” explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing core “managing people” activities (e.g., hiring and performance appraisal) – plus shifting the locus of management away from human bosses and into algorithms.  We’ll examine controversies around “gig work”, i.e., the positives of worker schedule flexibility vs. the negatives of algorithmic control.  We’ll also consider the metaverse and its potential for unleashing human creativity and fostering richer and more nuanced virtual communication - as well as providing organizations with new ways to monitor and control. •	Module 3: “Technology and Policy” examines three policy issues.  First, how can we inject more ethical criteria into the development of artificial intelligence and algorithms affecting work?  Second, what are the pros and cons of “universal basic income”, whose premise is that technological change will soon lead to an unprecedented amount of job elimination?  Third, how does “technology make us dumber”?  How can we avoid the obsolescence of critical human skills? Take this course to be ready to manage the strategic and analytic issues involving the design and implementation of technology at work - and for a preview of your own future work life. Requirements include: class participation; in-class quizzes; interviewing someone you know to ask how technology has affected their work life; and the “In Hindsight” group assignment looking back on past scares about a particular technology’s impact on work - and what actually happened.","P","MGMT2430002","","","WH","MGMT","Penn In Touch","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1888837","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=MGMT2430","2.965000"

In your career, your progress will depend on your ability to adapt yourself to tasks and cultures—and adapt the context around you to suit your strengths and goals. The purpose of this course is to enrich your knowledge and skills for achieving individual, interpersonal, and collective alignment. The content is evidence-based, and the learning method is experiential. In a diverse and inclusive learning community, you will be challenged to question your assumptions and test your ideas. The focus is on synchrony across a wide range of work settings—not only businesses, but also governments, sports teams, and nonprofits.","P","MGMT2950002","","","WH","MGMT","Penn In Touch","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1889252","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=MGMT2950",""

Do you want to set kids on a path to becoming financially literate? Do you want to learn leadership skills in the classroom? Here at the Financial Literacy Community Project (FLCP) we are able to create an experience that achieves all three. We partner with various public schools around the West Philadelphia area and teach concepts integral to financial literacy. We teach a wide range of grades from middle school to high school, and work with students to help them learn how to be financially responsible. In addition to teaching in neighboring high schools, we also have group class meetings run by Professor Keith Weigelt on Mondays from 7:00 PM-8:30 PM. We learn about the disparity of wealth and how to best address it while also learning teaching techniques, classroom strategies, and overall basic financial literacy. A basic understanding of personal financial literacy is required.

The goal of the course is to give students a realistic understanding of the roles, responsibilities and analytical skills required of market practitioners, as well as the tensions that arise between various stakeholders, including government officials, investors, entrepreneurs and the press. The underlying premise is that the basic rules for private equity in those countries are similar to the rules in more industrialized countries, but market participants face a broader range of issues in areas such as valuations, governance, legal structures, contract enforcement and regulatory transparency. To provide students with a practical grasp of the issues, classes will be a mix of lectures, expert guest speakers and business cases. Cases will highlight the challenges and tasks at each stage of the investment cycle, such as structuring and launching a new fund, originating new deals, conducting due diligence, creating value, monitoring the performance of portfolio companies and exiting. Each class will focus on a specific topic, ranging from the basics of how and why private equity funds operate to complex issues such as fund governance and adding value to family firms.","P","MGMT8090781","FNCE 6110","","WX","MGMT","","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1850130","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=MGMT8090","2.702857"

Firms in dynamic environments face substantial technological change, rapidly evolving competitive threats, and uncertainty around customer needs and demands.  This course provides a set of frameworks and theories which provide clarity and perspective to otherwise difficult and complex business decisions.  The course will address critical questions for managers of all types of firms facing complex and dynamic environments, such as: •	How do I understand if I am at risk of being disrupted, and what can I do about it? •	How can I create a successful strategy in new markets? •	What do my customers actually want? •	What does a good business model look like? •	How might new technologies impact my business and business model? •	How should I think about growth and profitability when building a new business? We begin the course by diving head-first into one of the most widely discussed yet widely misunderstood business theories of the past 30 years – disruptive innovation.  We will examine the two dominant types of disruption—low-end disruption and new market disruption—and seek to understand the unique characteristics and conditions which give rise to each.  We will then explore a variety of perspectives related to disruptive innovation—what type of strategy to apply when approaching new markets, how to make profitability vs. growth trade-offs, how to think about the nature of an industry’s technology evolution, and how to consider specific demand-side factors which impact which products gain traction in both new and existing markets.","P","MGMT8320701","","","WX","MGMT","","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1889359","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=MGMT8320","3.275000"

Economics concerns itself with goal directed behavior of individuals interacting in a competitive context. We adopt that general orientation but recognize that goal directed action need not take the form of maximizing behavior, particularly for organizations comprised of individuals with possibly divergent interests and distinct sub-goals. Further, we treat competitive processes as playing out over meaningful periods of calendar time and, in general, not equilibrating instantaneously. A central property of firms, as with any organization, is the interdependent nature of activity within them. Thus, understanding firms as ""systems"" is quite important, a perspective which has important implications for understanding processes of organizational adaptation. Among the sorts of questions we explore are the following: What underlies a firm's capabilities? How does individual knowledge aggregate to form collective capabilities? What do these perspectives on firms say about the scope of a firm's activities, both horizontally (diversification) and vertically (buy-supply relationships)? As a ""foundations"" course, readings will cover key conceptual foundations, but also provide an arc to current work --- an ""arc"" that will be developed more fully in our in-class discussions.","P","MGMT9000001","","","WP","MGMT","","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1876931","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=MGMT9000",""

Students will explore how brands, influencers, and platforms harness data to make strategic decisions. Each week pairs real-world case studies with hands-on Python labs to teach how to collect, process, and analyze social media data. Industry examples from  fashion, sports, and viral internet culture keep the content fresh and relatable. By the end of the course, students will have built a mini analytics project on a topic they care about — applying the tools professionals use to decode the digital world. This course has no prerequisites and is designed to be accessible to all students. No prior coding experience is required; all necessary Python skills will be introduced gradually during class. Each activity will be guided step by step to ensure full participation and confidence, regardless of background. For the assigned readings, students are asked to focus on selected sections, such as the introduction and data description, to gain a general overview. We will go through the more detailed parts together in class, so you can approach the readings without pressure and simply use them as a starting point for our discussions.","P","MKTG0005001","","","WH","MKTG","Penn In Touch","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1889044","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=MKTG0005",""

This course explores such questions with the goal of identifying the ingredients for building an inspired brand. The course is created for students interested in building a brand and/or immersing themselves in the enhancement of an existing brand, and it is comprised of lectures, cases, guest speakers, discussions, in and out of class exercises, and a final project. Broadly, the course will be divided into four parts: 1) Understanding Brand, 2) Crafting Brand, 3) Measuring Brand, and 4) Managing Brand. The course will provide students with an appreciation of the role of branding and (taking a consumer-centric approach) will augment students' ability to think creatively and critically about the strategies and tactics involved in building, leveraging, defending, and sustaining inspired brands.","P","MKTG7780701","MKTG 6110 AND (MKTG 6120 OR MKTG 6130)","","WX","MKTG","","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1877770","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=MKTG7780","3.376666"

Each of the GBW courses offered in a term, will entail travel to a different part of the world and address a different element of economic driver for a country or industry. A faculty member will drive the topic and curriculum associated with a study tour to a region of the world where the study of a topic will provide insights and clarity available only by being in country. In country lectures from the lead faculty and area experts in industry, academia and government will form much of the basis of class time. In addition, students will experience relevant company and cultural settings where they will again hear from industry experts. Each course will require an individual student paper, a participation component, and a pre-travel or in-country set of assignments. See course syllabus for details. CUSTOMER CENTRICITY AT THE LEADING EDGE OF ANALYTICS AND TECHNOLOGY: LEARNING FROM SCANDINAVIA. Instructor: Peter Fader. The concept of ""customer centricity,"" i.e., that not all customers are created equal, is gaining credibility and traction. More and more firms are coming to the realization that understanding and leveraging the behavioral differences across customers can potentially be more sustainably profitable than more conventional product- centric thinking that continues to dominate today's business landscape. At the heart of this transformation are three critical ingredients data, analytics, and technology. Using customer data at a granular level allows firms greater visibility into customer interactions, their use of social media, biometrics, and geolocation as tools to enhance business models and even create new ones. It allows a firm to be deliberate about which customers to go after and what kinds of services to provide them. For many, the key to profitable growth lies in successfully harnessing and developing the tools, organizational structures, and corporate cultures that create and enhance these capabilities.","P","MKTG8950701","","","WX","MKTG","","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1863970","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=MKTG8950","3.273333"

They also include such applied matters as design of logistics systems, auctions, and markets generally (for example, markets for electric power generation). In addressing these topics we focus on the practical problem of finding effective strategies for agents in strategic situations (or games). Our method of exploration will be experimental: we review and discuss experiments, principally computational experiments, on the behavior of boundedly rational agents in strategic (or game-theoretic) situations.

In consequence, models, data, and studies using them are publicly and profusely available, as is excellent journalism, which facilitates introductions to specific topics. The course covers selected topics in energy and sustainability. Essential background will be presented as needed, but the course is not a comprehensive overview of energy and sustainability. Modeling in the area of energy and sustainability analytics is rife with uncertainty, and yet decisions must be made. Uncertainty, and how to deal with it in model-based decision making, is an overarching theme of the course. We will focus on energy and sustainability, but that area is hardly unique in being beset with deep and vexing uncertainties. The lessons we learn will generalize. The overall aim of the course is to teach facility with modeling and to use real-world data, models, and studies in doing so. In addition, students with interests in investment or policy analysis in the energy sphere will find the course's subject area focus useful. OIDD 3250 is not a prerequisite for this course, but it's helpful if you have already taken it.","P","OIDD5250001","","","WM","OIDD","Course Match","https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1876892","https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?term=202530&course=OIDD5250","2.517500"

There are many reasons for this development: the emergence of a whole range of new complex financial instruments, innovations in securitization, the increased globalization of the financial markets, the proliferation of information technology and the rise of high-frequency traders, etc. In this course, models for hedging, asset allocation, and multi-period portfolio planning are developed, implemented, and tested. In addition, pricing models for options, bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and other derivatives are studied. The models typically require the tools of statistics, optimization, and/or simulation, and they are implemented in spreadsheets or a high-level modeling environment, MATLAB. This course is quantitative and will require extensive computer use. The course is intended for students who have strong interest in finance. The objective is to provide students the necessary practical tools they will require should they choose to join the financial services industry, particularly in roles such as: derivatives, quantitative trading, portfolio management, structuring, financial engineering, risk management, etc. Prospective students should be comfortable with quantitative methods, such as basic statistics and the methodologies (mathematical programming and simulation) taught in OIDD 612 Business Analytics or OIDD 321 Management Science (or equivalent).

The purpose of this course is to improve understanding of AI, discuss the many ways in which AI is being used in the industry, and provide a strategic framework for how to bring AI to the center of digital transformation efforts. In terms of AI overview, we will go over a brief technical overview for students who are not actively immersed in AI (topics covered include Big Data, data warehousing, datamining, machine learning, etc). In terms of business applications, we will consider applications of AI in Media, Finance, Healthcare, Retail, and other industries. Finally, we will consider how AI can be used as a source of competitive advantage. We will conclude with a discussion of ethical challenges and a governance framework for AI. No prior technical background is assumed but some interest in (and exposure to) technology is helpful.

Often, organizations will seek to go further, analyzing their own data to identify problems and learn what is working and what is not in their own context. This course applies the insights of the people analytics movement to help students become better managers and more critical analysts within their organizations. The course aims to develop students in three specific ways. First, it provides students with an up-to-the-minute grounding in current evidence about managing people, providing a knowledge base that can ensure that their future management is guided by best practices. Second, it develops the skills and understanding necessary to be thoughtful, critical consumers of evidence on people management, allowing them to make the most of the analysis available to them as they make people decisions. Third, it provides guidance and practice in conducting people analytics, preparing students to gather data of their own, and making them more skilled analysts.

Mathematical optimization provides a unifying framework for studying issues of rational decision-making, optimal design, effective resource allocation and economic efficiency. It is a central methodology of many business-related disciplines, including operations research, marketing, accounting, economics, game theory and finance. In many of the disciplines, a solid background in optimization theory is essential for doing research. This course provides a rigorous introduction to the fundamental theory of optimization. It examines optimization theory in two primary settings: static optimization and optimization over time (dynamic programming). Applications from problem areas in which optimization plays a key role are also introduced. The goal of the course is to provide students with a foundation sufficient to use basic optimization in their own research work and/or to pursue more specialized studies involving optimization theory. The course is designed for entering doctoral students. The prerequisites are calculus, linear algebra and some familiarity with real analysis, as covered in summer math camp.
